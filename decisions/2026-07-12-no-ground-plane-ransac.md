### 2026-07-12: No ground-plane RANSAC; vertical is georeferenced Z behind a symmetry gate

**Decision:** Ground and walls are removed by crop plus height cutoff only. The vertical reference for pitch is the cloud's georeferenced Z axis, and it is gated, not trusted: on a gable, half the pitch difference between opposing facets measures residual Z tilt. Residual at or below 1 degree: accept Z, report the residual as the pitch uncertainty floor. Above 1 degree: reject Z and level using the bisector of the opposing facet normals.

**Why:** Two independent reasons to drop the tyco ground-plane method here. Removal: on fragmented sloped woodland, the largest plane RANSAC finds may be a roof facet, not ground, since the roof is the densest continuous surface. Leveling: ground normal equals up only on flat ground; leveling to this hillside would inject the terrain slope into every pitch. Meanwhile georeferenced Z comes from meter-grade GPS whose accuracy as a gravity reference is unquantified, so it must be measured before any pitch is reported. The building's own symmetry is the instrument. The 1 degree gate is scale-independent (an angle) and sits comfortably below the roughly 3 degree spacing of adjacent standard pitches, so a passing residual cannot cause a pitch-class misread.

**Rejected:** `fit_ground_plane` plus `level_cloud` as used on tyco (both premises broken on this site). CSF cloth-simulation ground filtering (handles slope but adds a dependency this cloud does not need).

**Evidence:** Terrain slope and roof density from visual inspection of the rendered cloud. Georeferenced Z accuracy: assumption, not verified; the gate exists precisely because of that.

**Cost if wrong:** If the gate threshold is too loose, every pitch carries up to 1 degree of hidden bias. If the house turns out to have no symmetric gable pair, the gate has no instrument and a fallback reference must be designed.
