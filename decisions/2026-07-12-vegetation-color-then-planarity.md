### 2026-07-12: Vegetation removed by color then planarity; rests on the roof-is-not-green assumption

**Decision:** Two sequential per-point filters before segmentation: Excess Green (`ExG = 2G - R - B`, unitless) removes the green canopy bulk, then a local planarity score (neighborhood covariance eigenvalues, unitless cutoff, radius derived from median point spacing) removes the gray/brown residue.

**Why:** Trees touch the roof, so position filters cannot separate them; only per-point signals can. Color and local geometry are independent signals with non-overlapping failure modes: color misses shadowed and dead foliage, planarity erodes roof edges and ridges. A foliage point must be both non-green and locally sheet-like to survive both, which is rare in canopy.

**Explicit assumption:** the roof is not green. True for big_house (gray shingle, verified visually) and this is the only reason ExG works. It fails outright on a green-painted, moss-covered, or copper-patina roof; on such a roof stage 3 must be disabled and planarity carries the whole job.

**Rejected:** RANSAC alone (foliage within the inlier band of a real facet gets counted as roof, inflating area and skewing pitch, silently). Normal-direction filtering (foliage normals are random, per the 2026-07-12 adversary entry). Planarity alone (its edge-erosion failure mode would have no backstop).

**Evidence:** Visual inspection: gray shingle roof, green July canopy. Filter effectiveness on this cloud is assumption, not verified; the per-stage visual checks are the verification plan.

**Cost if wrong:** Surviving foliage contaminates facets and inflates area; over-aggressive filtering erodes facet boundaries and shrinks it. Both are caught by the stage 7a integration test if the visual checks miss them.
