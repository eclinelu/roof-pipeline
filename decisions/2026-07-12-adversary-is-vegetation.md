### 2026-07-12: The adversary is vegetation, not walls

**Decision:** Roof isolation must be designed primarily against overhanging trees, not against walls.

**Why:** The original plan assumed walls would dominate RANSAC, based on the Tyco orbit footage. The `big_house` capture was a nadir grid, so walls reconstruct thin and partial while the roof is dense. Walls are no longer the problem. Trees overhang the roof directly, and foliage normals are random rather than horizontal, so a normal-direction filter (the obvious wall filter) will not remove them.

**Rejected:** Building the wall-removal filter as originally planned. It solves a problem this cloud no longer has.

**Evidence:** Visual inspection of the rendered `big_house` cloud. Roof surface is continuous and dense; walls are fragmentary; trees are clearly intersecting the roof volume.

**Cost if wrong:** Foliage points get counted as roof, inflating total area. Area error scales directly with contaminated points.
